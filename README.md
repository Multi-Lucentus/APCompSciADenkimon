# APCompSciADenkimon

This is a parody of the Pokemon games using the Slick2D library I made in my senior year of high school for my AP Computer Science A class.
At the time, this was my first big project, so it is a little unorganized. I uploaded it to GitHub when I first started using Git, so it is also uploaded without the libraries used.
I still view it as a good comparison point to check against to see how far I have come.
